“Data visualization is the graphical representation of information and data. By using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualization tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.” In the specific context of this map depicting the geographical data of Detroit, data visualization has played a crucial role in transforming complex information into visual forms, especially highlighting the locations where black children had unfortunate accidents on these streets. Data visualization helps observers intuitively grasp the distribution and concentration of these events, helps black children understand the terrain to reduce the risk of being hit by cars, and also reveals a serious social problem. The deep-rooted social issues include the unfairness of race and violence, the malpractice of the police, and the fact that the law does not safeguard the safety of black people's lives at all. The persistence of such social problems may perpetuate fear and insecurity among black communities and other minority groups, mainly due to the external stereotypes and discrimination they face. The importance of data visualization is that it can reveal the obvious differences and problems society faces. It calls for action to urge people to address these issues and strive to create a more just and equitable future for all. :smile:

## Data Viz Biography

**1. Who or what institution produced the visualization? (Hint: refer to "Figure Credits")**  
Gwendolyn Warren and the Detroit Geographical Expedition and Institute.  

**2. When was it produced?**  
1971  

**3. Who is the audience for the visualization?**  
The audiences include local residents and community members who want to know the dangers black children face in the local area; government officials responsible for urban planning and traffic safety; advocates for social fairness and justice who fight against racial inequality; researchers and scholars interested in urban geography and racial inequality.  

**4. How might the visualization be interpreted or misinterpreted? What consequences might this interpretation/misinterpretation have?**  
The visualization interpreted can effectively raise awareness among residents, governments, and police about the problem of black children being crushed by cars in the area. This interpretation will improve traffic regulations, policies, urban planning, and safety measures and increase public appeal for racial equality.  
The information misinterpreted by this map may attribute all the causes of the accident to white drivers and not consider other factors, such as lack of infrastructure and incomplete laws and regulations. This misinterpretation may lead to a narrow understanding of the problem and hinder the resolution of broader potential causes. The map may also strengthen the stereotype of the community. The public may feel this community is hazardous and has strong racial inequality. This misunderstanding will affect community cohesion and future development.  

**5. How, if at all, does the data visualization represent power or systems?**  
The data visualization of the map reflects the event of black children being killed by a car, which can represent the problem of power and systems. This phenomenon reveals the power imbalance between white drivers and black children. Black people are marginalized in this community and society, and we must seek fair power relationships. Regarding systemic issues, accidents are concentrated in the community, reflecting racial differences, economic inequality, infrastructure deficiencies, and inadequate safety guarantees. The local government needs to make systematic changes in transportation, urban planning, laws, and regulations to protect the safety and well-being of black people.
